### Three Tier Web Architecture in VPC using Terraform.

I have created Single Nat Gateway for demo. Using a single NAT gateway for two availability zones can be a cost-saving strategy compared to having a NAT gateway in each availability zone. In cloud environments like AWS, NAT (Network Address Translation) gateways are used to allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from reaching those instances.
